There are 2 scopes of memory
* General scoped memory - this is the memory that is shared across all conversations and is used to store long term information about people.
* Conversation scoped memory - this is the memory that is specific to the current conversation and is used to store short term information about people.
This is where pronouns are stored, so they can be resolved to the correct person in the current conversation.
